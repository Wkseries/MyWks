      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      I found "Big Mouth" to be quite engaging. The story captivated me right from the beginning with its unique premise and well-developed characters. Lee Jong-Suk's performance as Park Chang-Ho was particularly impressive. He portrays the transformation from a bumbling lawyer to a cunning con artist with remarkable skills. His character's struggle and determination to protect his family kept me hooked throughout the series. The drama's intricate plot and numerous twists kept me on the edge of my seat. Each episode unveiled new layers of mystery and intrigue, making it hard to predict what would happen next. The writing is sharp and clever, keeping the viewers constantly guessing about the true identity of "Big Mouse." I appreciated how the show balanced intense moments with lighter scenes, providing much-needed relief amidst the tension. Im Yoon-Ah also delivered a stellar performance as Go Mi-Ho. Her unwavering support for her husband and her own journey to uncover the truth added depth to the narrative. <br><br>
      The production quality of "Big Mouth" is commendable. The cinematography, especially the use of contrasting lighting and shadows, effectively heightened the suspense. The soundtrack complemented the mood of the scenes, enhancing the overall viewing experience. One particular scene that stood out to me was when Park Chang-Ho outsmarted the cops and adversaries after jail breaking the prison just to expose them and then returned himself. This scene showcased not only his intelligence but also his growth as a character. Another memorable moment was Go Mi-Ho's confronting surgeons with higher position at the hospital just to expose they dirty work, this highlighted her strength and determination. <br><br>
