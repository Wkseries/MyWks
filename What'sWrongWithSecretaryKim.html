      <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      In the world of big business, Lee Young-joon, a narcissistic vice president, thrives with the help of his capable and ever-reliable secretary, Kim Mi-so. Their well-oiled professional dynamic hides a surprising truth: Mi-so, after nine years of flawless service, decides to quit.   Young-joon, thrown for a loop, tries everything to keep her.  His world revolves around her efficiency, and the thought of losing her throws him into a tailspin.  As he desperately tries to unravel Mi-so's reasons for leaving, the drama explores their unexpected connection and the line between professional duty and something more.  Will Young-joon convince Mi-so to stay? And what secrets might their past hold that could change everything?  "What's Wrong With Secretary Kim" is a delightful romantic comedy that promises a heartwarming journey of self-discovery and the power of a strong working relationship. 
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      "What's Wrong With Secretary Kim" is a delightful romantic comedy that offers a blend of humor, charm, and chemistry between the leads. One of the drama's strongest points is the impeccable chemistry between the leads, Park Seo Joon and Park Min Young. Their on-screen dynamic is captivating, making their romantic evolution believable and engaging. Park Seo Joon perfectly embodies the self-centered yet endearing Young Joon, while Park Min Young's portrayal of the competent and determined Mi So adds depth to the story. The humor in the series is well-executed, often stemming from Young Joon's exaggerated sense of self-importance ‚ÄúAURA‚Äù. For example, his incredulous reaction to Mi So's resignation and his subsequent attempts to keep her in the company are both hilarious and endearing. <br><br>
      I loved how the supporting cast adds depth and humor to the narrative. Characters like Kim Mi-so's quirky coworkers and Young-joon's eccentric family members give further charm to the series. I also like that while we are centered on the romance between the two leads, the show also delves into themes of self-discovery, family dynamics, and personal growth. Each episode offers new insights into the characters' lives, that kept me watching further more. The drama also shines in its production quality. The settings, from the luxurious office spaces to the picturesque dates, are visually appealing and enhance the viewing experience. The soundtrack complements the emotional beats of the story, adding to the overall ambiance. <br><br>
      However, the drama felt a bit repetitive few times, especially with the numerous misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts that arise, some scenes seem to stretch out scenarios longer than necessary, making the pacing uneven. There is only one minor issue; the secondary characters. While some, like Young Joon's brother, Lee Sung Yeon, add valuable context and depth to the main storyline, others feel underdeveloped. The office colleagues, although providing comic relief, sometimes fall into stereotypical roles, which can detract from the overall narrative. <br><br>
