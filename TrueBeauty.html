      <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      True Beauty dives into the life of Lim Ju-kyung, a high school student struggling with insecurities about her appearance.  Feeling ostracized for not fitting conventional beauty standards, Ju-kyung discovers the transformative power of makeup.  Through dedicated practice, she becomes a makeup whiz, crafting a persona that stuns everyone at her new school.  However, beneath the flawless exterior, Ju-kyung worries her secret will be exposed. The story unfolds as Ju-kyung navigates the complexities of high school life, juggling friendships, budding romance, and the constant fear of being discovered.  She forms a connection with Lee Su-ho, a popular classmate with a hidden past, and Han Seo-jun, a rebellious student with a surprising soft spot.  As Ju-kyung embraces her newfound confidence, the drama explores themes of self-acceptance, inner beauty, and the importance of finding your true voice. 
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      While watching ‚ÄúTrue Beauty" and found it to be a delightful and engaging series. The show does a great job of exploring themes like self-esteem, beauty standards, and personal growth. While watching it, I find it chill and stress less to watch with it less complicated love story. Lim Ju-kyung, the protagonist, is a high school girl who feels insecure about her appearance and uses makeup to transform herself. Her journey is both relatable and inspiring as she navigates the challenges of adolescence and self-acceptance which all of us need to learn to do. One of the highlights for me was the chemistry between the characters. The love triangle involving Ju-kyung, Lee Su-ho, and Han Seo-jun was well-developed and added an interesting dynamic to the story, it wasn‚Äôt too complex and always exposed to our faces. Su-ho's calm and caring nature contrasts beautifully with Seo-jun's rebellious and misunderstood persona, making it hard not to root for both of them at different points in the series, wishing for her to marry them both at some point. <br><br>
      The show also touches on important social issues. For example, Ju-kyung's struggle with bullying and her transformation through makeup shed light on the pressures faced by young people to conform to societal beauty standards. It was heartbreaking yet empowering to see her gradually gain confidence and stand up for herself. The comedic elements in "True Beauty" were another strong point. Ju-kyung's interactions with her family provided many laughs, especially her playful yet supportive relationship with her younger brother with his farts or her mothers and cutting foot nails during a fight and her older sister and her love with Ju-kyung‚Äôs teacher. Also the scenes where Ju-kyung tries to keep her bare-faced identity a secret from her classmates led to many humorous situations. Visually, the drama is stunning. The makeup transformations are impressive and well-executed, highlighting the talent and effort put into Ju-kyung's character development. The fashion and styling throughout the series are also noteworthy, making the series more realistic and hoping to find such clothes in our daily life. <br><br>
