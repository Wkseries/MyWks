        <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
        It is a Korean drama released in August 2024, featuring an intriguing psychological thriller storyline. The plot follows Sang-joon and his son Ki-ho, whose lives become intertwined with dark secrets hidden in a secluded forest. As the narrative unfolds, viewers are drawn into a slow-burn mystery that shifts into a more intense, fast-paced thriller in the second half. Ki-ho, played by Park Chan-yeol, returns seeking revenge, while Young-ha‚Äôs daughter refuses to back down, leading to gripping confrontations.<br>
        The drama explores themes of revenge, trauma, and community solidarity, with beautiful cinematography that heightens the tension. However, the pacing is uneven at times, and certain character arcs, such as those of Bo-min and Gi-ho, feel underdeveloped. The relationship between Young-ha and Sang-joon adds emotional depth, and although the show has its flaws, including some unresolved plotlines, it still manages to captivate with its atmosphere and intensity. Despite mixed reviews, many appreciate its rich, layered storytelling and visually striking moments. Fans of psychological thrillers may find it worth watching for its unique take on the genre.<br>
