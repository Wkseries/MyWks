      <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      In "It's Okay to Not Be Okay," we meet Moon Gang-tae, a dedicated caregiver who works at a psychiatric hospital while also looking after his older brother, Moon Sang-tae, who lives with autism spectrum disorder. Their lives take an unexpected turn when they cross paths with Ko Moon-young, a popular children's book author known for her dark and unconventional stories.  Despite their contrasting personalities ‚Äì Gang-tae is cautious and protective, Moon-young is blunt and emotionally distant ‚Äì a connection sparks between them. As they navigate their personal struggles and past traumas, they begin to heal and find solace in each other's company. The drama explores themes of mental health, emotional vulnerability, and the importance of human connection.  Prepare for a heartwarming journey of self-discovery, acceptance, and the power of love to overcome challenges. 
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      "It's Okay to Not Be Okay" left a lasting impression on me. The show is a remarkable blend of emotional depth, visual beauty, and compelling storytelling. One aspect that really stood out to me was the character development. Moon Gang-tae, played by Kim Soo-hyun, is a caretaker for his autistic brother, Moon Sang-tae. The portrayal of their relationship is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. The way Gang-tae suppresses his own emotions to take care of his brother is incredibly moving. There's a scene where Gang-tae finally breaks down, and you can feel the years of pent-up frustration and sadness pouring out. It's one of the most powerful moments in the drama. I still remember they fight phrase ‚ÄúGang-tae belong to Sang-tae‚Äù, when he said that I felt goose bumps and anger. On the other hand, we have Seo Ye-ji, who plays Ko Moon-young, brings a unique charm to her character. Moon-young is a children's book author with an antisocial personality disorder, and her journey throughout the series is fascinating to watch. Her interactions with Gang-tae are filled with tension and tenderness, especially in the scene where she insists on eating with him and Sang-tae despite their initial reluctance. Her determination to break through their barriers adds a lot of emotional weight to the story, and her past with her mother add a deep layer to the story. There is too much pain to watch in those series! <br><br>
      The show's cinematography is another highlight. Each frame is crafted with such care, creating a fairy-tale-like atmosphere that complements the narrative perfectly. The scenes in the psychiatric hospital, for instance, are shot in a way that makes the place feel both eerie and oddly comforting. It‚Äôs a beautiful contradiction that mirrors the show‚Äôs themes of healing and acceptance. The supporting characters also add depth to the story. Sang-in, Moon-young‚Äôs publisher, and Joo-ri, a nurse who has feelings for Gang-tae, provide much-needed comic relief without undermining the seriousness of the main plot. I have to said it, it is a must watch! <br><br>
