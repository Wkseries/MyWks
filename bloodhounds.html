        <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      Bloodhounds plunges you into a gritty world of debt and desperation. The story centers around two men, Gun-woo and Woo-jin, whose lives become intertwined due to crushing financial burdens.  With their backs against the wall, they're forced to take extreme measures to escape their situation.  Prepare for a high-octane ride packed with heart-pounding action sequences as they become entangled with a dangerous loan shark organization.  The drama also boasts a strong female presence, with characters who are more than just damsels in distress.  Expect to see a compelling bromance develop between Gun-woo and Woo-jin as they fight for survival and navigate the morally murky waters they find themselves in. 
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      While the story of "Bloodhounds" might not be the most original, it kept me glued to the screen. I found myself laughing more than expected thanks to the show's silly moments, and the undeniable chemistry between the lead duo which had me rooting for them from the very beginning. The action scenes were top-notch, and the acting, especially from the leads, was phenomenal during the train station fight. It's a suspenseful show with a great storyline, well-written characters, and fantastic action sequences that showcase the unbreakable bond between Gun-woo and Woo-jin. <br><br>
      Despite being only 8 episodes, the show never felt rushed, even with the unexpected departure of one character near the end. The performances, particularly Gun-woo and Woo-jin's, were amazing, their fighting skills were seriously impressive! I loved seeing Woo Do-hwan and Lee Sang-yi showcase their impressive boxing skills, and the camerawork during these scenes added to the intensity and excitement. The way the show initially set up the conflict and introduced the villain, Kim Myeong-gil, was impressive too. His despicable character full of hypocrisy, cruelty, and cold violence genuinely evoked hatred in me. <br><br>
      However, around episode 6, the show took a sharp turn. The pacing slowed down, the plot became careless, and new characters were introduced without development. I was particularly disappointed with the handling of the revenge plot. Having anticipated an epic showdown between the leads and Kim Myeong-gil, I felt the writers lost their way. The final episodes were confusing and unsatisfying, with many unanswered questions. Their friendship was one of the few bright spots in the later episodes, and I'm glad they didn't kill off Woo-jin. You can say the first half was excellent, but the second half was a letdown but I still enjoyed watching it. <br><br>
