      <h4>My Opinion:</h4>
      After I finished watching "My Demon," I am left with a mix of emotions and thoughts about this drama. The show delves into the supernatural world with a unique twist, focusing on demons and their interactions with humans in a way that kept me intrigued throughout. I have to admit the characters were well developed. The lead actors delivered strong performances, especially in portraying the internal conflicts and emotional turmoil of their characters, reflecting they characters personalities and they daily life struggles. The pacing of the drama was well-balanced, it had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing to watch it to the end to know the truth about the original stories and the events that happened before leading to the present. Its mix of suspense, drama, and supernatural elements. I appreciated how the show explored themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. <br><br>
      I disliked that the plot felt predictable, but the visual effects created a captivating viewing experience. In addition, there were too many questionable scenes; when Gu Won takes Do-Hee to the river in attempt to get his powers back. At first she thought he was going for 18+ or a kiss, im like damn girl you only met him few times, chill. But some funny scenes saved the series; like the tango dance fight or the names (Park Fuck you) and support characters jealousies. On the other hand, the writing keep getting messier towards the end; Gu Won is supposed to be immortal, but Do-Hee still tries to save him from a bullet. I know her actions was a act of love and sacrifice but still! She knew about his immortal after being stabbed. The religion was a big red flag in the series; they shown churches, the devil, and priests sharing secrets from confessions, but then talk about reincarnation, which isn't part of Christianity at all 0-0. They even show God as a beggar, this is an insult! The ending would have been better if he died, because let‚Äôs be realistic, at some point Do-Hee will eventually die of old age, while Gu Won will lives forever. How can they have a love story if one of them dies at some point?
