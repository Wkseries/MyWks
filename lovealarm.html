  <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
  Love Alarm dives into a world where a popular app dictates your love life.  This app, simply called Love Alarm, notifies users when someone within a certain distance has a crush on them.  The story follows Kim Jo-jo, a high school student hesitant to embrace the app due to a painful past.  However, her world gets complicated when two very different boys trigger her Love Alarm - the charming Hwang Sun-oh and the quiet but observant Lee Hye-young.  As Jo-jo navigates this new reality, the drama explores the complexities of modern love.  The app's limitations and societal pressure surrounding it create a unique set of challenges for the characters.  Love Alarm delves into themes of trust, vulnerability, and the courage to follow your heart in a world obsessed with digital validation. 
  <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
  This drama hooked me with its unique concept: an app that detects romantic feelings. The idea is both fascinating and unsettling, and the show delves deeply into the consequences of such technology on our lives. Kim Jo-jo is the character who truly resonated with me. Her journey of self-discovery and navigating love in a world obsessed with quantifying emotions felt relatable and powerful, she didn‚Äôt feel wrong to be different from other by not downloading the app at first. The actress delivered a stellar performance, portraying a range of emotions with incredible subtlety.
  The supporting cast shines as well, adding layers and complexity to the story. I particularly enjoyed the dynamic between Hwang Sun-oh and Lee Hye-yeong. Their friendship and rivalry added a layer of tension that kept me engaged, I thought they would go on 1 v 1 fight to win her heart since I felt Sun-oh was a spoiled kid  but they were friends rather than ennemi, adding a fight scene could have been interesting though. <br><br>
  What I truly appreciated about "Love Alarm" was its willingness to tackle tough social issues like bullying, sexual assault, and societal pressures. The show didn't shy away from these sensitive topics, handling them with maturity. The way Hye-yeong handled the fact that a boy loved him was quite impressive. I was expecting some kind of fight ngl between them since before this scene the same boy bullied another boy for loving him. But can we talk about the first time Kim Jo-jo and Hwang Sun-oh, like  damn girl, I wouldn't kiss a guy I met a minute ago and surprisingly fell inlove with hin the next day. However, while the concept is interesting, the idea of blindly trusting an app for your love life felt unrealistic to me. I mean, who would let an app dictate their emotions? The show does explore the darker side of this reliance on technology, which I appreciated. I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the quick ending leaving me hanging.  <br>

  <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
  Picking up after the events of season 1, Love Alarm season 2 dives back into the complicated love triangle between Jojo, Hye-young, and Sun-oh.  The world with the Love Alarm app continues to be a source of both connection and confusion. Jojo embarks on a relationship with Hye-young, a kind and understanding guy.  However, unresolved feelings and lingering questions about the app cloud their connection.  Meanwhile, Sun-oh remains in the picture, still hoping to win Jojo's heart. This season explores themes of self-discovery, navigating love with technology in the mix, and the courage to follow your heart.  Expect to see Jojo grapple with her true feelings, the characters deal with the limitations of the app, and the story delve deeper into the world's dependence on this technology for love. 
  <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
  Is Season 2 worth watching? Here's the thing, I find it's a mixed bag. There are still good moments, and it touches on important themes. But it doesn't live up to the first season. If you're a fan, give it a shot, but don't expect the same emotional impact.
  Season 2 left me with conflicting feelings. While Season 1 was a breath of fresh air in the romantic drama genre, exploring the complexities of love in a digital age. The pacing was a major sticking point for me. The story felt jumpy and rushed, like the writers were cramming too much into too few episodes. This lead to characters development suffered, and I also felt disconnected from the various storylines. It felt forced, like they were trying to manufacture a connection that wasn't there.
  Another letdown was the shift in focus. Introducing new characters is great, but Season 2 spent so much time on them that the original cast felt neglected. I missed the dynamic between the characters from Season 1, their chemistry and emotional depth were what made the show so captivating. However, it's not all doom and gloom. The show still tackles important social issues, like societal pressures and technology's impact on relationships, like some group of people suicide due to they love alarm never rang.
  Thankfully, the acting remains strong. The cast delivers solid performances despite the script's limitations. <br><br>
  The reason why season 2 was mostly hated is because of Jojo's New Love Interest. Most team were on team Sun-ho, we wanted her to end up with Sun-ho. But another reason could be that in Season 1 at the ending there was a cliffhanger, but in Season 2 they did not continue with that! They just showed at least 1 or 2 months later. The storyline was overall, confusing. I mean it was shown 4 years later, So love should be kinda mature. The chemistry between Hye-yeong and Jojo was nothing compared to Sun-ho and Jojo. We don‚Äôt even know that how Jojo became Hye-yeong‚Äôs gf. They introduced us Hye-yeong as Jojo's new love interest, just a few episodes in, are we supposed to believe she's fallen for him? There's barely any build-up or chemistry between them. The writers try to compensate with a grand confession scene, but it falls flat because their relationship development feels rushed. 
  The show also struggled to juggle multiple storylines without giving them proper attention. Take Jojo's best friend Duk-gu. His struggle with sexuality was an interesting addition, but it felt underdeveloped and overshadowed by the main love triangle. I can say Season 2 was a huge disappointment compared to the first season, but it has its moments. <br>
