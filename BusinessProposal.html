        <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      Shin Ha-ri, a food researcher with a crush on a co-worker, gets roped into a hilarious situation. Her best friend, Jin Young-seo, a wealthy socialite, begs Ha-ri to go on a blind date in her place. Ha-ri, disguised and ready to scare off the date, is shocked to discover it's none other than Kang Tae-moo, the CEO of her company! Unbeknownst to Tae-moo, who's tired of endless blind dates set up by his family, Ha-ri's over-the-top personality accidentally convinces him she's perfect for marriage. Now, Ha-ri must juggle keeping her true identity hidden while navigating a fake relationship with her boss. Expect mistaken identities, workplace chaos, and a sizzling romance that unfolds amidst the pressure of keeping the truth under wraps. 
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      As a fan of romantic comedies, I thoroughly enjoyed watching "Business Proposal." The drama captures the essence of a classic rom-com while infusing it with the unique charm of Korean drama elements. One of the aspects I appreciated the most was the chemistry between the lead characters, Shin Ha-ri and Kang Tae-moo. Their interactions are both heartwarming and hilarious. A prime example is the scene where Ha-ri, impersonating her friend, goes on a blind date with Tae-moo, only to realize that he's her company's CEO. The ensuing awkwardness and attempts to maintain her disguise create some genuinely funny moments. Samantha and Rachel was the best thing that she ever said. The secondary characters also add depth to the story. Jin Young-seo and Cha Sung-hoon have their subplot that is just as engaging. Young-seo‚Äôs straightforward and bold personality contrasts well with Sung-hoon‚Äôs calm and collected demeanor. Their relationship provides a nice balance to the main couple‚Äôs dynamic, especially in scenes like the one where Young-seo tries to win over Sung-hoon with her clumsy yet endearing efforts. Jumping in his arms while being afraid of a spider was the best of her moves but don‚Äôt forget ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cross the line‚Äù. <br><br>
      The drama does an excellent job of combining humor with more serious themes. For instance, Tae-moo‚Äôs struggle with his grandfather's expectations and his own desire to lead a different life adds a layer of depth to his character, but not gonna lie, his grandfather was right, Tae-moo is old it is enough time for him to find a wife properly. The scene where he confronts his grandfather about his controlling nature is particularly poignant, highlighting the generational and ideological clash in a relatable way. Visually, "Business Proposal" is a treat. The cinematography is vibrant and colorful, perfectly matching the light-hearted tone of the series. The fashion is also noteworthy, with each character‚Äôs wardrobe reflecting their personality and status. Ha-ri‚Äôs transformation from a regular office worker to a glamorous date is especially well-executed, adding to the believability of her dual life. The soundtrack complements the series beautifully, with catchy tunes that enhance the emotional impact of various scenes. The music during romantic moments is particularly effective, making the chemistry between the characters even more palpable, I can‚Äôt forget the music ‚ÄúLove, Maybe‚Äù. <br><br>
