      <h4>No Spoilers:</h4>
      Vincenzo Cassano, a Korean-Italian lawyer with a sharp mind and a ruthless streak, returns to South Korea after years working as a consigliere for the Mafia. His arrival coincides with a hidden fortune buried beneath a seemingly ordinary building. However, a corrupt conglomerate, Babel Group, has its sights set on the building and its treasure. Unwilling to let them exploit the tenants, Vincenzo and a tenacious lawyer named Hong Cha-young join forces to protect the residents and their hidden fortune. Together, they use cunning strategies and a touch of Mafia flair to fight back against Babel's corrupt practices. As the battle unfolds, Vincenzo builds an unlikely family with the quirky tenants, forging bonds that redefine justice and challenge the power dynamics of the conglomerate.
      <h4> My Opinion:</h4>
      After watching "Vincenzo," and I have to say, it's one of the most entertaining K-dramas I've seen in a while. The series masterfully combines elements of crime, thriller, and dark comedy, making for a unique viewing experience. Song Joong-ki, who plays the lead role of Vincenzo Cassano, delivers a stellar performance. His portrayal of a suave and cunning mafia consigliere returning to Korea is both captivating and nuanced. One scene that particularly stands out is when Vincenzo ridiculized Babel Group CEO when he was introducing himself to the world, he gave him a shower of pig blood. Vincenzo is the best at acting, improvising and bringing chaos to world and to the court especially when he stopped the court from happening. The way he convince his surrounding is very clever. <br><br>
      Jeon Yeo-bin, as the feisty lawyer Hong Cha-young, brings a lot of energy and charisma to the series. Her chemistry with Song Joong-ki is palpable, adding an extra layer of depth to the storyline. I enjoyed watching her character's evolution from a somewhat self-serving lawyer to a determined fighter for justice. For instance, her transformation becomes evident during the courtroom scenes, where she fiercely battles against the odds to bring the truth to light. But when she break out of character is hilarious like when she act like an American with her English accent. <br><br>
      The supporting cast is equally impressive. Ok Taec-yeon, who plays the villain Jang Jun-woo, is a revelation. His duality as a seemingly harmless intern who later reveals his true psychopathic nature is chilling and compelling. The way he switches between his two personas is seamless and adds a significant tension to the narrative. The cinematography and direction are top-notch, with each episode being visually engaging. The dark, sleek aesthetics of the mafia scenes contrast beautifully with the vibrant and chaotic environment of the Geumga Plaza residents. Speaking of which, the quirky residents of Geumga Plaza provide much-needed comic relief, balancing the darker aspects of the show. Their interactions and subplots are endearing and often hilarious, making them an integral part of the drama. <br><br>
